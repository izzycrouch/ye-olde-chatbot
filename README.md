# ye-olde-chatbot

## Summary
In this repo I have huilt a chatbot using Python and pre-trained models (LLMs) and then retrained it to speak like a character from a Shakespearean tavern.

## Objectives
    - Build a chatbot using Python and pre-trained models
    - Explore parameters and configurations for model behaviour
    - Implement a simple user interface for interaction
    - Explain the role of a system prompt in guiding chatbot responses
    - Experiment with fine-tuning and custom prompts to guide chatbot behaviour
